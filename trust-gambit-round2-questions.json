    "question": "Four young women from Da Ban Town have distinct dowries. A suitor interviews them in a fixed sequential order. Upon meeting each woman, he learns her dowry and must immediately either choose her (ending his search) or reject her (he cannot return to her later). If he rejects the first three, he must choose the fourth.\n\nSuppose the suitor's goal is to maximize his probability of choosing the woman with the highest dowry. If he uses the optimal strategy, what is his probability of success (as a percentage rounded down to nearest integer)?",

Each second, it takes a step: forward (towards the precipice) with probability \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), or backward (away from the precipice) with probability \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). If the horse ever steps forward from the brink, it falls.\n\nWhat is the probability that the horse eventually falls into the precipice, rounded to the nearest integer percent?",
