## 8. Complete State Flow Example

### Example: User Journey Through One Round (Question)

1. **Initial State**: `FORM_INCOMPLETE`
   - User fills all 10 domain ratings + personal info
   - Transition to `FORM_COMPLETE`

2. **Lobby Request**: `FORM_COMPLETE`
   - Admin sets game to `GAME_STARTED`
   - "Request Lobby" button enables
   - User clicks button
   - Transition to `LOBBY_REQUESTED`

3. **Lobby Assignment**: `LOBBY_REQUESTED`
   - System finds Lobby #3 with 12/15 members
   - User assigned to Lobby #3
   - Transition to `LOBBY_ASSIGNED`

4. **Waiting**: `LOBBY_ASSIGNED`
   - User views other 12 members in "Players Tab"
   - Reviews self-ratings of potential delegation targets
   - Transition to `WAITING_FOR_ROUND_START` (when stage starts)

5. **Round 1 Begins**: `WAITING_FOR_ROUND_START` → `ROUND_QUESTION_DISPLAYED`
   - Admin starts Round 1 (Question 1, Algorithms domain)
   - Question appears on screen
   - User has options: Solve, Delegate, Pass

6. **Action Selection**: `ROUND_QUESTION_DISPLAYED` → `DELEGATE_SELECTED`
   - User clicks "Delegate"
   - Switches to "Players Tab"
   - Finds Alice with rating 9 in Algorithms
   - Selects Alice from dropdown
   - Returns to question view

7. **Submission**: `DELEGATE_SELECTED` → `ANSWER_SUBMITTED`
   - User clicks "Submit"
   - System locks submission for this round
   - Message: "Waiting for other players (8/15 submitted)"
   - User CANNOT change delegation choice

8. **Processing**: `ANSWER_SUBMITTED` → `WAITING_FOR_ROUND_END`
   - All 15 players submit for Round 1
   - System builds delegation graph for Round 1
   - System detects: User → Alice → (Alice solved correctly)
   - System calculates scores for Round 1

9. **Round 1 Results**: `WAITING_FOR_ROUND_END` → `ROUND_RESULTS_DISPLAYED`
   - Trust graph updates and displays Round 1 data
   - User sees: Delegated to Alice (distance k=1)
   - Alice solved correctly (+1)
   - User score for Round 1: λ^1 = 0.5
   - Alice received 3 delegations, trust bonus: +0.9
   - Cumulative scores updated (includes Round 1)

10. **Next Round**: `ROUND_RESULTS_DISPLAYED` → `WAITING_FOR_ROUND_START`
    - Admin starts Round 2 (Question 2)
    - Cycle repeats for all 20 rounds in Stage 1

## 12. Error States & Edge Cases

### 12.1 Form Validation Errors
- **Incomplete Rating**: Show which domain is missing
- **Invalid Rating**: Must be 0-10
- **Missing Email**: Show validation message
- **Duplicate Email**: Prevent registration

### 12.2 Lobby Assignment Errors
- **Game Not Started**: Show "Game has not started yet"
- **All Lobbies Full**: Move to LOBBY_QUEUE state
- **Already Assigned**: Prevent duplicate assignment

### 12.3 Submission Errors
- **Already Submitted**: Lock UI, show error
- **No Action Selected**: Disable submit button
- **Delegation to Self**: Show validation error
- **Network Timeout**: Retry mechanism, save locally

### 12.4 Processing Errors
- **Cycle Detection**: Handle gracefully, show cycle visualization
- **Scoring Calculation**: Validate with test cases
- **Trust Graph Generation**: Handle disconnected nodes

---

## 13. Performance Considerations

### 13.1 State Updates
- Use optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Debounce form field changes
- Batch state updates for multiple users

### 13.2 Real-time Synchronization
- WebSocket for live submission counts
- Polling fallback for trust graph updates
- Cache player profiles to reduce API calls

### 13.3 Scalability
- Pagination for large player lists
- Lazy load trust graph visualizations
- Compress historical data

---

## 14. Security Constraints

### 14.1 Data Access Rules
- Users can only see players in their lobby
- Submissions are encrypted until round ends
- Admin actions are logged and auditable

### 14.2 State Manipulation Prevention
- Server-side validation of all state transitions
- Prevent client-side state tampering
- Rate limiting on form submissions

## Summary

This state machine ensures:
1. ✅ Request Lobby only works when form is complete
2. ✅ Lobby assignment only when game has started and capacity available
3. ✅ Exactly one answer per round (question) per user
4. ✅ Trust graph not updated until round results are displayed
5. ✅ Players can view profiles in separate tab during delegation
6. ✅ Clear state transitions with proper constraints
7. ✅ Admin controls for game flow (stages and rounds)
8. ✅ Proper error handling and edge cases
9. ✅ Real-time synchronization support
10. ✅ Security and data access controls

**Terminology Summary**:
- **Stage**: Major phase (Stage 1 with 120 players, Stage 2 with 16 players)
- **Round**: Each individual question (20 rounds in Stage 1, 8 rounds in Stage 2)

The state machine is designed to be:
- **Deterministic**: Clear transitions and conditions
- **Scalable**: Supports 120 players in Stage 1, 16 in Stage 2
- **Robust**: Handles errors and edge cases
- **User-friendly**: Clear UI states and feedback
- **Secure**: Prevents cheating and data leaks
